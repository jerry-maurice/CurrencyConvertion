This app is written in Python and uses the Django framework. It uses a mysql database which consist of 2 tables along with the user and group table which are already included in the Django framework. Upon login in, the first page which is the homepage displays a beautiful slideshow. Each image shown is also accompanied with a caption that display the rate of change. Below the slideshow the user can see all the conversion (transaction) made during the day. In order to do a conversion, the user would have to go to the transaction page. The transaction by default save the time and the day the transaction was done which allow the user on the home page to view the same day transaction.
